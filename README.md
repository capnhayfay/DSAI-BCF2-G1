# Welcome to Credit Card Fraud Prediction

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 - Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
Our data was [Simulated Credit Card Transactions generated using Sparkov](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).
For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. [Data Encoding, Resampling and Splitting](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Resampling.ipynb)
2. [Data Visualization](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1)
4. [K-Nearest Neighbours Classification](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1)
5. [Random Forest Regression](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1/blob/main/)

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict if a Credit Card Transaction is Fraudulent?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. KNN Classification
2. Random Forest 

## Conclusion

- Popularity and budget have low linear correlation value with ratings (watch out for bandwagons ðŸ¤£)
- Popularity of the casts and crews have higher linear correlation value with ratings
- Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance especially on the minority class
- Logistic Regression did not perform well with non-linearly correlated variables
- Neural Networks along with SMOTEENN resampling method consistently did well in predicting good movies after 100 training attempts (around 72% accuracy, 70% recall)
- Yes, it is possible to predict if a movie is good with acceptable amount of accuracy and recall

## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods and imblearn package
- Neural Networks, Keras and Tensorflow
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- API Usage
- Other packages such as tqdm, json, requests
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
