# Welcome to Credit Card Fraud Prediction

### About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 - Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. <br>
We used [Simulated Credit Card Transactions Generated Using Sparkov](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) as our dataset. <br>
You can access our code in the following order to understand it best:

1. [Data Encoding, Resampling and Splitting](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Resampling.ipynb)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1)
3. [K-Nearest Neighbours Classification](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1)
4. [Random Forest Regression](https://github.com/capnhayfay/DSAI-BCF2-G1/blob/main/)

### Problem Definition

- How are we able to predict if a credit card transaction is fraudulent?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

### Models Used

1. KNN Classification
2. Random Forest Classifier

### Conclusion

- To Be Continued....

### What did we learn from this project?

- Understanding importance of encoding categorical variables in modelling
- Managing highly imbalanced data using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
- Random Forest Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbours Classification
- Understanding classification results and applying them to data
- Collaborating using GitHub
